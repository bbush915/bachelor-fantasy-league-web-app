          <p>
            To play you must join a league. You can search for a league to join or create your own.
            The person who creates the league is the League Commissioner and can invite other
            players to join their league. New players can join a league any time during the season.

          <h2 class="my-4">Setting your lineup</h2>
          <p>
            Once you have joined a league, you can access the League Home Page, where you can set
            your lineup. You set your lineup each week by selecting contenstants who you think will
            receive a rose. You can edit your lineup until 8pm EST the day the episode airs. Once
            the episode airs the lineup will be locked. If you donâ€™t set your lineup you will
            receive 0 points for that week. After the episode ends you can set your lineup for the
            following week.
