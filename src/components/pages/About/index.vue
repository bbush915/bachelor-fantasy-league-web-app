        <h2>Joining or creating a league</h2>
        <p>
          To play you must join a league. You can search for a league to join or
          create your own. The person who creates the league is the League
          Commissioner and can invite other players to join their league. New
          players can join a league any time during the season.
        </p>
        <h2>Setting your lineup</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have joined a league, you can access the League Home Page,
          where you can set your lineup. You set your lineup each week by
          selecting contenstants who you think will receive a rose. You can edit
          your lineup until 8pm EST the day the episode airs. Once the episode
          airs the lineup will be locked. If you donâ€™t set your lineup you will
          receive 0 points for that week. After the episode ends you can set
          your lineup for the following week.
        </p>
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>
          After the episode ends the scores will be calculated. Scores will be
          displayed the next day on the League Home page.
          <br />
          <br />
          You will receive points for each contestant in your lineup who
          receives a rose. The number of points earned is based on the week
          number. In week 1 you will earn 1 point per contestant, in week 2 you
          will earn 2 points per contestant, etc.
          <br />
          <br />
